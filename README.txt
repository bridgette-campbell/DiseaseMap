# DiseaseMap
Team 1 - Bridgette Campbell, Daniel McBride, Matt Qunell

Features implemented: download disease data from Centers for Disease Control's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System to display to the user, log in, choose from a list of diseases to view, choose a time period of the disease to view  

User stories implemented: As a user, I can specify a time period and disease so that I have access to more specific and/or relevant information. As a user, I can create an account and sign in.

Bugs/issues: We had issues getting the Google sign-in to work so we implemented basic user credential storage in the meantime. 

Notes: We will implement more diseases in the future. We currently have three: Haemophilus Influenza, Tetanus, and Chicken Pox
