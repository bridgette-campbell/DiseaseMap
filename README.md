# DiseaseMap
Team 1 - Bridgette Campbell, Daniel McBride, Matt Qunell

Features implemented: download disease data from Centers for Disease Control's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System to display to the user, log in with a Google account, choose from a list of diseases to view, choose a time period of the disease to view 

User stories implemented: As a user, I can specify a time period and disease so that I have access to more specific and/or relevant information. As a user, I can sign in via Google so that I donâ€™t need to make a new account.

Bugs/issues: We had some issues getting the Google sign-in to work in the beginning.
